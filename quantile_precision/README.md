# Quantile Precision
**Assignment Goal**<br>
Write a blog post to answer a series of questions related to the variation of the median (and a range of other quantiles).

**Audience**<br>
The audience of your blog post is a Senior Data Scientist who you hope to work with in the future. Be sure to mention any assumptions of your solution.

### Assignment Details
For these distributions, create the below graphs and answer the below questions.
* Calculate the length of the middle 95% of the sampling distribution. Your empirical sampling distribution should be at least 5000 draws.
* Graph both Length vs p-th quantile and length vs density of this sampling distribution
* When does the median have the tightest sampling distribution?

**Distributions**
* Normal
* Exponential (rate = 1)
* 2 Mixed Distributions (see code)


### Technology Used 
**R** (tidyverse, data.table, ggplot2, gridExtra, RColorBrewer)
