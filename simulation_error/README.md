# Simulation Error: Monte Carlo
**Assignment Goal**<br>
Write a blog post that demonstrates the concepts of absolute error and relative error when estimating probabilities from simulation.

**Audience**<br>
The audience of your blog post is an HR manager tasked with hiring a data scientist. The HR manager is looking for candidates who are able to clearly explain why a concept is important and demonstrate the concept in action.

### Assignment Details
Perform a 14 X 5 factorial experiment simulation that estimates the error for each combination of replicate number and probability value. (0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50)
** Replicates:  (2^2, 2^3, [â€¦], 2^15) 
** Probability: (0.01, 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50)

Calculate both absolute and relative error and interpret the results


### Technology Used 
**R** (ggplot2, gridExtra)
