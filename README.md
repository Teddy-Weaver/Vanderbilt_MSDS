# Vanderbilt_MSDS
This is a collection of work that has been done while a Master of Data Science student at Vanderbilt (2019-2021).

Below is a brief overview of the courses taken to date. More information on the broader curriculum can be [found here](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/datascience/academics/msprogram/curriculum/).

**Principle of Programming & Simulation** - Introductary programming taught in both Python and R. Focused on effective software design and programming practices, how to program and evaluate a simulation, and how to apply modern resampling techniques in simulations.

**Probability of Statistical Inference** - Fundamentals of probability theory and statistical inference. Topics in probability include random variables, distributions, expectations, moments, Jensenâ€™s inequality, law of large numbers, central limit theorem. Topics in inference include maximum likelihood, point estimation (Bayesian, frequentist, and likelihood versions); hypothesis and significance testing; re-sampling techniques.

**Exploratory Data Science** - How to explore, analyze, graph, and communicate real-world data. Topics include principles of perception, scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, bar charts, dynamite plots, proper data summaries, dimensionality reduction, multidimensional scaling, and unsupervised clustering algorithms (principal component analysis, k-means clustering, nearest neighbor algorithms).

**Survey of Data Science** - Exposure to how data science is used in a variety of fields, both in idustry and for research.
